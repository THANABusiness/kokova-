## Forming the layout in TokenScript

### Resources
All the files to complete this tutorial are contained in the example nft directory [here](https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples/tree/master/examples/EntryToken).

### Adding your layout
Since TokenScript is essentially an XML dialect, it is possible to plug in your existing layout files in HTML, CSS and JS. To begin, simply clone this repo and take a look at the token.en.shtml and enter.en.shtml files inside the example NFT directory. 

    $ git clone https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples && cd TokenScript-Examples/examples/EntryToken

This demo will go through an example token which allows you to enter fake Satoshi's house with an NFT token and a challenge response off chain.  

## View iconified and regular layout
In our wallet, you can render both an iconified and regular view. The iconified view is shown
in the wallet token card and gives a summary of all the tokens you have within a contract.

It looks something like this:

The regular view is displayed after a user clicks on a particular token and it shows all the 
functions available to the user as well as a more in depth view of the token. It looks something like this:
